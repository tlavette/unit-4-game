<!-- Personal note section:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::


       // function letterSearch(){
            // var guess = newWord;
            // var search = str.match();


        // Need newWord to be saved and display to show number of dashes = to character count of newWord.
    
    Example 1
    I started out with a flow chart of what I though how the process should flow.
    This led me to begin with the initial action of creating an array of the words.
    Working with the first word, no loops I played with solutions on how to find a match.

     const words = ["bottle", "flower", "guitar", "lobster", "statue"];
        let newWord = words[0];
    
    
    let c = words[0][3];
        console.log(c);

        if (c.indexOf(newWord) > -1){

            alert("Your letter is in this word!");
        }

    
    
    Example 2
    I found this second option to be more of what I need. But I realize I need to utilize key pairs.

var myString = "bottle";
var inThere = myString.match("v");
if (inThere) {
  console.log(" It is in there")
}
else {
   console.log("It is not in there")
